# CHATBOT Over PDF 

## About the project

The project will aim on implementing a basic Question-Answering Chatbot for external PDFs using Retrieval Augmented Generation on a pre-trained Language Model. Throughouth this project, mentees will dive into Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and PyTorch, while exploring deep learning concepts such as Neural Networks, RNNs, and State-of-the-Art Transformers. 

- The project will be 5 weeks long. 
- Python is the only prerequisite.
- Each week mentees will be given resources to study and small assignments.
- 7-10 hours of time commitment is expected from mentees.(However, this can vary from week to week).
- Finishing assignments before deadline is mandatory for certification.

Feel free to contact me and discuss among yourselves about the project.

> [!TIP]
> Leverage ChatGPT, Stackovreflow, Documentations, Youtube and other resources to their fullest.
