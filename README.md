# CHATBOT Over PDF 

## About the project

The project will aim on implementing a basic Question-Answering Chatbot for external PDFs using Retrieval Augmented Generation on a pre-trained Language Model. Throughout this project, mentees will dive into Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and PyTorch, while exploring deep learning concepts such as Neural Networks, RNNs, and State-of-the-Art Transformers. 


- The project will tentatively be 5 weeks long. 
- Python is the only prerequisite.
- Each week mentees will be given resources to study and a small assignment to practice.
- 7-10 hours of weekly time commitment is expected from mentees._(However, this can vary from week to week)._
- Finishing assignments before deadline is mandatory for certification.


_Feel free to contact me or discuss among yourselves about the project._


> [!TIP]
> Leverage ChatGPT, Documentations, Youtube and other resources to their fullest.
