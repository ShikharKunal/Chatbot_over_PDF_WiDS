# Week 3: Understanding Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Welcome to Week 3 of our NLP journey! This week, we'll delve into the fascinating world of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and explore how they can be used to process sequences of data, such as sentences and text.

## Coursera Course

### **Strongly Recommended**

**Complete the first two weeks of the course ["Sequence Models" by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models?) on Coursera.**

This course covers essential concepts related to sequential neural networks and word embeddings. You can audit the content for free, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the topics we'll cover this week.

## Understanding RNNs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to process sequences of data. Learn the basics of RNNs and how they maintain a memory of past inputs:

- [**PyTorch Docs - Implementing models using classes**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/modelsyt_tutorial.html)

## Optimizers

Optimizers are pivotal for training deep learning models. They adjust model parameters during training to minimize the error or loss function. Familiarize yourself with common optimizers like SGD and Adam:
