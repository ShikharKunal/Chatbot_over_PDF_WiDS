# Chatbot using Hugging Face Transformers Library

## Objective
Build a QnABot using the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Description
Create a QnABot that uses a pre-trained LLM from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The QnABot should be able to answer user queries.

## Structure
1. **LLM Model Initialization**: Select a pre-trained LLM from the Hugging Face Transformers library and initialize it for QnABot usage.
2. **User Interaction**: Develop a very basic user interface to facilitate interactions with the QnABot.
3. **Handling User Queries**: Implement logic to process user queries and pass them to the LLM for generating responses.

## Deliverables
- Submit a Python script, GitHub repo, Jupyter notebook, or Colab notebook with the code.
- The code should include a functional UI for user interaction.

## Tips and Advice
- Leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library for easy integration of pre-trained LLMs.
- Explore different LLMs available in the Hugging Face Model Hub.
- Encourage users to experiment with the QnABot and provide feedback for improvement.

## Add-on Assignment (Optional)(Highly recommended)
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model for a specific downstream task and create a simple demo app to interact with it.
    - What dataset you use and what downstream task you choose is up to you.
    - You can find a dataset on Kaggle, Hugging Face, or anywhere else.

Feel free to customize the assignment based on your preferences and learning goals. The goal is to create an interactive and engaging chatbot using the powerful capabilities of the Hugging Face Transformers library.
